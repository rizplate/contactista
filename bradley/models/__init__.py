# The ordering of this file is a little strange, but it's intentional,
# in order to avoid circular dependencies. First, we do library imports.

from sqlalchemy_continuum import make_versioned
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from flask_alembic import Alembic
from flask_security import Security

# Then we set up the data that the models depend on, like the `db` instance
# from Flask-SQLAlchemy.

make_versioned()

alembic = Alembic()

# Now we can import the models.
